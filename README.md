# Project Title

AfterPay Skills Assessment Test

## Assumptions
Data will be coming in small batches over time. Results will be stored in memory on system. Most likely this would be run as a server. Web services would be used to input transaction data. At the time data is added the fraud test would be run.

If this was a run as one time job against a large transaction data file a more efficient process could be used. The data file could be parsed with a simple regex parser.

## Getting Started
